The research employs wavelet transform for feature extraction and evaluates patterns using two-class classification. Artificial signals from chaotic systems (Lorenz, Rossler, Chen) and real-world EEG data are analyzed. A unique pattern recognition framework optimizes feature sets for classifiers like decision trees, KNN, SVM, MLP, and LSTM. Key steps in the proposed framework include:

- Feature Extraction: Extracting RMS, peak values, crest factors, kurtosis, and energy sub-band features using discrete wavelet transform (DWT).

- Feature Visualization and Standardization: Normalizing features for consistency and inspecting distributions via plots.
  
- Classification: Employing advanced classifiers tailored to the nature of the data.

The studyâ€™s focus on EEG patterns during emotional tasks demonstrates potential applications in mental health interventions, including PTSD therapy, evaluated with various physiological metrics like EEG and ECG. The streamlined two-class classification reduces data requirements and complexity, facilitating the identification of task-specific brain activity patterns.
